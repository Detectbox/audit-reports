            <h1>Who are We ?
            </h1>
            <p>We, the founders of UNSNARL are two Techies from IITs in India and have deep knowledge and experience in
                Web3 and cyber-security. Having spent time closely with teams at Polygon and some renowned founders in
                Web3, we feel that Auditing in Web3 is inclined towards <b>blind trust on big brands</b> but a shift
                towards a mix of trust on Talent and Brand is happening. At the end of the day, its the auditors who are
                putting in the work. We aim to play a pivotal role in this shift. </p>
