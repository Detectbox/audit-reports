Want independent auditors to do your audit ?


Hire the top independent auditors across the globe, group them to form an audit team and get an extensive 3-Layer audit with maximum code coverage from DetectBox. We have Detect-Wardens on our side to monitor the progress of the work, resolve discrepancies between the client and audit team, and perform audit mitigation.


Who are We ?

We, the founders of UNSNARL are two Techies from IITs in India and have deep knowledge and experience in Web3 and cyber-security. Having spent time closely with teams at Polygon and some renowned founders in Web3, we feel that Auditing in Web3 is inclined towards blind trust on big brands but a shift towards a mix of trust on Talent and Brand is happening. At the end of the day, its the auditors who are putting in the work. We aim to play a pivotal role in this shift.
